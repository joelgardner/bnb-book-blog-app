#### Guide to building a React/Redux app

The post is not currently done, but is divided into 3 parts (so far).

- Part 1: [Basic Technologies Overview](https://github.com/joelgardner/react-node-app/blob/master/Post1.md)
- Part 2: [Setting up our Backend](https://github.com/joelgardner/react-node-app/blob/master/Post2.md)
- Part 3: [Setting up our Backend... continued](https://github.com/joelgardner/react-node-app/blob/master/Post3.md)

There will probably be 5 or 6 parts, when all is said and done.
